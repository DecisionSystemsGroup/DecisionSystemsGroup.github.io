As the second DSG workshop is now history, it is time to see an aftermath of
the Python workshop, organized by Charis Dimos.

In this workshop [Charis][cd] began explaining the concept and difference
between a "programming" language and a "scripting" one. Then, he analysed the
philosophy of Python and compared Python with other popular languages.

After he was done with those theoritical explainations, he moved to develop a
first program, in which he demonstrated the practicality and simplicity of
Python.

By the end of the workshop he had explained, through examples, how to use
functions and classes.
The workshop ended with the promise of a second workshop about more advanced
concepts coming next.
