Last Thursday we returned to Python with a workshop presented by Charis Dimos,
the presenter of the original Python Workshop and guest presenter Petros
Douveas, to see some more advanced features and techniques we can use with
Python.

Having a successful "Introduction to Python" and ended the workshop with the
most positive feedback, [Charis][cd] decided to do a Part2 of his first
[Python Workshop][pw] as promised.

For this second part Charis had also help from Petros Douveas.

The request for the second workshop was that the attendees wanted the workshop
to be a little more security driven.

The workshop began by having a recap of the previous workshop and then
explaining how to use files in Python. After that some basic security concepts
were explained.

Then Charis and Petros created an analysed a simple keylogger in Python and how
it works, mentioning changes in the code for becoming a more advanced one.

For the final part of the workshop, the started discussing network security and
demonstrated a port scanner written in Python.
