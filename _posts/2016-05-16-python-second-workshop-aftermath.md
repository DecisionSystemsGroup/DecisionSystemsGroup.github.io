Last Thursday we returned to Python with a workshop presented by Charis Dimos,
the presenter of the original Python Workshop and guest presenter Petros
Douveas, to see some more advanced features and techniques we can use with
Python.

In this workshop [Charis][cd] began explaining the concept and difference
between a "programming" language and a "scripting" one. Then, he analysed the
philosophy of Python and compared Python with other popular languages.

After he was done with those theoritical explainations, he moved to develop a
first program, in which he demonstrated the practicality and simplicity of
Python.

By the end of the workshop he had explained, through examples, how to use
functions and classes.
The workshop ended with the promise of a second workshop about more advanced
concepts coming next.
