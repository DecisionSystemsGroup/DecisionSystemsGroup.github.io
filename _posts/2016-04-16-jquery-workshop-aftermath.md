Get to know the Web 2.0 with one of the most famous Javascript Libraries:
jQuery in last Thursday's jQuery Workshop presented by Stavros Tsourlidakis.

In this workshop [Stavros](http://dsg.teiste.gr/team/tsourlidakis-stavros/) talked about [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), one of the most used JavaScript libraries.
During the first half of the talk we explored the basic concepts around DOM selection/manipulation and general jQuery methods.

On the second half of the talk he demonstrated how to create a very basic data driven single page application by using HTML/CSS/JavaScript and jQuery.
You can find the documentation [here](https://github.com/DecisionSystemsGroup/workshop-jQuery) and a working demo by clicking on the screenshots below.

Also, with [John](http://dsg.teiste.gr/team/prantalos-john/)'s help we managed to livestream the workshop and later upload it to our  [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb4w_1fp8ef-eka0wJ1--Ow).
