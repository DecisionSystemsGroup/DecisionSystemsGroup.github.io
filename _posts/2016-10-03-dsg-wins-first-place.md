DSG Team took part in this weekend's Crowdhackathon #insurance. Little we knew,
the DaaM platform they built was the one that won the 1st place and the 2000€
prize.

For the first time, in a hackathon that DSG participated, except from
[John][jp], [Stavros][so] and [Stavros][ss] who are active members of the
team, one of the original pre-2014 DSG members, [Dimitris][db] was part of the
team too.

The purpose of the event was to built a solution for the insurance companies
that improves the current insurance infastructure. The theme was pretty
abstract and we saw from arduino implementations to web platforms and AI bots.

The DSG team built DaaM, a platform that utilizes realtime driving data from
various providers and enables them to see the quality of their customers.

The platform has gamification features, such as leaderboards, prizes and a
point system that is heavily based on the data collected from the providers.

For the event the provider of the data was [Hermes-V][hv] a service that was
born here at DSG labs by [Dimitris][db] and became a company that now has
revenue.

The collaboration between the team members was excellent and that lead to a
very cohesive project that was good enough to win the first prize and the
2000€.

As always, you can find the project files and more about DaaM at its
[project page][daam] here in the DSG website.
