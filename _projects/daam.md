**DaaM** is a driving analysis and monetization platform for car insurance
companies and car owners as well.

Insurance companies can login via a webapp, see the driving behavior of their
clients and choose rewards for the top drivers. The platform organizes the
drivers in ranks with a sophisticated algorithm.

Users can see their rank and driving profile, rewards that they are eligible
and notifications from the insurance company about new insurance offers via
the mobile app provided.
