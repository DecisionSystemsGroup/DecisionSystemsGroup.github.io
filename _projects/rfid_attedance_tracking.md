A usefull Attendance Tracking System built with Arduino that utilizes RFID
for authentication.

Applications of RFID Based Attendance System
---------------------------------------------
RFID based attendance system can be used in educational institutions,
industries, anywhere.

RFID is emerging technology and is used in applications where authentication
is needed.

Limitations of RFID Based Attendance System:
-------------------------------------------
RFID attendance system is secured, but there is a chance of misusing the
cards. One person can give another person's attendance if he/she had RFID
card.

If the card was swiped for more than once, there is a chance of giving
attendance for next days also if code is not written properly.
