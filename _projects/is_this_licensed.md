A web application for those who want to see if a photo is licensed. Delevoped
by the DSG team for the Koding Hacksummit 2016 Hackathon.

The user uploads a picture to the app which then communicates with the Flickr
API and check if there is a similar picture uploaded there.

If there is, it returns the picture with its information and the copyright if
available.

The app was built for integration with the Flickr API, but it is easy to add
more data providers and improve the app's searching abilities.
