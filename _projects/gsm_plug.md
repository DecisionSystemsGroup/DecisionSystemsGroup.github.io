GSM plug is a normal plug but with a great advantage: you can power it on by
sending an SMS.

How does it work :

* GSM-plug is an independent controller which can be guided through a GSM
network available.
* It is based on gsm-shield for arduino which accepts short messages (SMS).
* A simple communication protocol with simple commands is built in the GSM-plug
in order to control any device connected to the GSM-plug.
* This is shown here with a lamp connected to it that can be turned on or off
through any mobile device by sending the relevant command.
