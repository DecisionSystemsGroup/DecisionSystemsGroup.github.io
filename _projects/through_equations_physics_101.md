The goal of this project is to combine entertainment, learning and increase
problem-solving skills of the player/student through a series of riddles and
mini-games that take place in a simulated environment that represents real
life.

The story evolves around the life of a high school student named Dimitris that
through his experiences we see how physics are applied from the 2D blackboard
to the 3D real world.

The aim in this game is to capture the attention of the players/students and
take them through a journey of understanding the basic laws of physics.
The game is being developed in UDK by George Karabelas, Theodore Kounas and
Christos Vassis.
