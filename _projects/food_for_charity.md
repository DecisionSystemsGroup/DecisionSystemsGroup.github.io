Food4Charity is a platform for suspended food purchase, DSG built for the
Battlehack Athens 2015.

In the last years a trend appeared, mostly in coffee shops where anyone can
buy a coffee for homeless or low-income people.

When you buy a suspended coffee, you pay the amound of money you would for a
regular one but the store does not serve you the coffee.

Instead they store the suspended coffees to a list and when a homeless person
comes and requests a suspended coffee, the store makes and serves one prepaid
from a previous customer.

What DSG did, is extend the suspended coffee idea to food restaraunts as well
and provide an easy platform for stores and customers to buy and consume
suspended food.
